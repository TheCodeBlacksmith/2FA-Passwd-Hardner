This 2FA sample is designed to strengthen password-based authentication by incorporating data from a second factor (often known as two-factor authentication, or 2FA). This will employ the Linux login command implementation and in order to reduce the impact of offline guessing attacks, information kept by the system to verify the legitimacy of a login request is updated after each login request.
